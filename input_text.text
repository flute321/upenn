I wanted to start off by saying thank you for reading my application and I appreciate the time you are putting aside to look at my resume and cover letter. My name is Suchita Hadimani, and I am a sophomore at George Mason University, majoring in computer science. I have been interested in programming for several years. This past summer, I developed an interest in understanding what machine learning is and how to use it. Since then, I have registered for a couple machine learning courses, including the well-established Machine Learning Specialization in Coursera conducted by Andrew Ng. I have been practicing my skills by building my own neural networks and binary classifications systems based on publicly available databases. I am planning to start the second specialization, which is in Deep Learning, as well. While it was enjoyable analyzing the data in these databases, I would like to do something with real impact on society. When I saw the posting for Kashmir World Foundation on Handshake asking for interns who could create neural networks and train datasets, I knew I had found a perfect match. My knowledge of machine learning would blend well with the requirements for the internship. Wildlife conservation is becoming increasingly important by the day as our world is rapidly developing and changing. I would like to help the snow leopards by contributing my skills in computer science. Although I am still a beginner in many regards, I am ready to work hard and learn new skills as I go. I hope to bring a positive attitude, resilience, and effective communication to the team. ,
