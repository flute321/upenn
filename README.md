## Inspiration
I've had to read lots papers for the research that I was involved in. While I was reading the articles I would find myself getting very immersed into it, but by the time the next day rolled around, I would forget some of the smaller details. My professors would ask what tests a certain researcher used or what the independent variables were, and while I had a general idea I would often get it mixed up with another study that was similar. I would have to scramble through my notes and figure out the answer. If only I had all the major points of the article listed out, I would be able to look at it before and after reading the paper solidifying it into memory and then need not more than just a quick glance if a professor ever asked.
## What it does
It gives a summary of a research paper highlighting all the major points such as the independent variable, dependent variable, statistical tests, models, and major research results.
## How we built it
I built it on python using the openai and metaphor apis.
## Challenges we ran into
I was having some trouble trying to figure out how to parse the text and then also to create a user interface for it, which I eventually ended up not having time for.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
creating a somewhat functional model.
## What we learned
Learning how to use APIs and make api calls 
## What's next for QuickGlance
-Making it scrape information given from URLs instead of pdfs
-Creating an interface
